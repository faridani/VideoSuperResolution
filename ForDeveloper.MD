# Developer Guide

This repository implements a simple video super‑resolution model in PyTorch. It is organized as a minimal proof‑of‑concept with a single training script and accompanying README.

## Repository Layout

- **`video_sr.py`** – main script containing dataset loading, model architecture and training loop.
- **`README.md`** – brief overview and setup instructions.
- **`LICENSE`** – MIT license text.

There are no additional modules or configuration files. All training parameters are defined at the end of `video_sr.py`.

## Key Components

### Dataset
`VideoSuperResDataset` loads short sliding windows of frames directly from video files and produces low‑resolution/high‑resolution pairs on the fly.

### Model Architecture
The model is built from several parts:
- `Encoder3D` with 3D convolutions for spatio‑temporal encoding.
- `TemporalFusion` to collapse the time dimension.
- `TransformerBottleneck` for non‑local interactions.
- `Decoder2D` with pixel shuffle upscaling and a placeholder deformable convolution.
- `DiffusionRefinement` using a pre‑trained Stable Diffusion XL UNet.

### Losses
Training combines L1 reconstruction, a VGG16‑based perceptual loss, a CLIP semantic loss and a temporal consistency term.

### Training Loop
`train_model` (at the bottom of `video_sr.py`) creates the optimizer, computes the combined loss, and prints per‑epoch progress. Training parameters such as window size and scale can be changed in the `__main__` block.

## Next Steps and Learning Resources

- Experiment with different video datasets to see how the model performs.
- Study the 3D convolution and transformer parts of PyTorch if you are unfamiliar with them.
- Look into deformable convolution implementations if you want a real alignment module (the current layer is a placeholder).
- Explore the `diffusers` library to understand how diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are used for refinement.
- Consider adding tests, checkpoints, and dataset preprocessing for a more production‑ready project.

For further detail, consult the code in `video_sr.py` and the feature list in the README.
